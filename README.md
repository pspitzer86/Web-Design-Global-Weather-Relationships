# Web-Design-Global-Weather-Relationships

In collaboration with Kate Spitzer.

The purpose of this assignment was to take plots and data used in previous homework Python API Challenge and create a website around them with certain qualifications for various sections of the website.  Those are as follows:

Navbar:
Must be done in Bootstrap style, have a title for the webpage that whe clicked returned user to the main home page of this website.  On the right side of navbar should be a dropdown for the Plots of Latitude vs. Max Temp, Humidity, Wind Speed and Cloudiness each of which took you to a page about that particular plot, a Comparisons tab that took you to a page of a Comparison between the the four plots, and a Data tab that took you to a page with a table of the cities used in the homework.  The Navbar also needed to be responsive so that when the page was re-sized smaller, the right three tabs turned into a hamburger that when clicked, dropped down to show the three tabs.  Each of these other pages needed to have this Navbar and it needed to function the same way on each page.

Home Page:

Using bootstrap column styles and classes, the left portion of the home screen needed a title and a general photo of some relation to the data being shown and a small summary of what was done in the previous homework and what this website would have for the user to view.  On the right portion needed to be a Visualizaions section that used Bootstrap column styles to show a small image of each of the four plots that were linked to their individual pages.  The entire page had to be responsive so that when re-sized smaller, the visualizations first formatted from two columns into one column and then one column below the main image and summary paragraph.  The main image needed to grow smaller with the re-size while remaining relatively centered in its bootstrap column.  The title had to stay relatively centered along with the image and the summary paragraph needed to wrap around to remain in its bootstrap column.

Each individual plot page:

Using the same bootstrap columns and styles as the home page, each individual plot page needed the same visualizations grouping to the right of the page that linked to their pages.  The left portion needed a large image of its associated plot and a small summary of the trends and conclusions of that plot.  The reponsiveness of these pages needed to be exactly the same as the home page.

Comparisons page:

Using bootstrap columns and styles, the four plots had to be placed equidistant to each other in order to show a general comparison between them for conclusions to be made generally by the user.  The responsiveness of this page needed to work similarly to the Visualizations section on all other pages, just on a larger scale.

Data page:

The csv of the cities used in the previous homework needed to be run through a jupyter notebook in order to reorganize it and turn it into an html file for its page.  The Data page was to hold a table of the city data for the user to see.  The responsiveness of this page needed to allow the table to still be viewable in general even if the page was re-sized smaller.  This was done by coding scroll bars onto the table.

All pages needed to have some way of linking to each other.
